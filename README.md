# Interview Questions for Senior Positions

Thank you for your interest in Flexential!  We have put together a few questions that are designed to challenge your way of thinking.  We want to see whether you are able to solve these questions, and in which manner you solve them.

These questions are designed to test your knowledge on C# language syntax, problem solving, design patterns, and algorithms.  You will not be timed or graded on how much you google.  You will only be graded by the finished product.

## Instructions

This test will require the .NET Core 3.0 update and an IDE capable of compiling .NET Core code, such as Visual Studio.

Clone this repository to your local drive and open the solution with the IDE of your choice.  Your goal is to have all Unit Tests (MSTest) pass.  You will not need to change any of the Unit Tests in order to accomplish this, you will only need to modify the underlying code referenced in the Unit Tests.

If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to me at nathan.rose@flexential.com
